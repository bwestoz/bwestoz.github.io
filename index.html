      <p class="text-justify">The JGSWA was founded by Ian Macgregor and Garry Lee in May 1989 and was formed at a workshop conducted by the late Emily Remler (who would have been our first patron, but for her untimely death). Our first newsletter consisted of 4 pages typed out by Garry's wife Sue. Our second newsletter came out about 6 months later and was put onto computer by our first editor, committee member Mike Slaven (l990-91), who really created the newsletter's basic style. </p>

Since 2003 the JGSWA has been privileged to have as our main sponsors, leading Perth music shop Zenith Music. </p>
